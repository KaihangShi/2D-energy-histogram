This folder contains CIF files for amorphous porous materials (APMs) used in this work. 

Some other useful files are also included here:
1. Force field file (force_field_mixing_rules.def) that can be used in RASPA2 software for grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation.
2. Textural properies for APMs (textprop_apm.csv).
